-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The primary purpose of the Inventory application is to monitor and manage items in a list. It aids in automating warehouse logistics and facilitating business growth by tracking items within an app. Users can conveniently access real-time inventory information from any android device, enhancing the flexibility of their sales and stock.

-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The application should include a mechanism to promptly notify the user whenever the quantity of any item in the inventory reaches zero. This feature ensures that users are promptly informed about depleted stock levels, enabling them to take necessary actions such as restocking or making alternative arrangements. By receiving timely notifications, users can effectively manage their inventory and smooth out the whole process.

-How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

Firstly, API 16 was chosen for the benefit of emcompassing 99.8% of android devices. The login activity serves as the initial screen and consists of five components arranged in ConstraintLayout. The loginAuth function is responsible for authenticating the user against the users table in the app's database and determining whether they are authorized to use the app. For the visual design to be properly applied It helped me in looking at similar apps in the play store and taking their architecture as inspiration before following through with the addition of buttons and text fields around the app. 

-How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The built in android emulator in android studio served alot of purpose in the constant rechecking of any additions in the design fo the app. Its one thing writing functional code but seeing its behavior being altered in "real time" creates a continous flow of work. This process is not only important for the functionaltiy of a product but to weigh its performance and mitigate any issues in optimization. 

-Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When considering the development process from start to finish a challenge that I overcame was the implementation of input data valdiation and the other proper security practices that overall enchances the applications data and resources.

-In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

While developing the app it helped refine a security conscious approach that focuses on anticipating potential vulnerabilities in software architecture and designs. Also identifying and addressing design flaws to ensure privacy and protect against potential threats. By following best practices and industry standards, it becomes more accessible to create computing solutions that prioritize security and safeguard sensitive information.
